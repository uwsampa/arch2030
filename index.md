# Molecular Information Systems Lab
{:.no_toc}

The Molecular Information Systems Lab (MISL) at UW-CSE explores information technology uses of molecular-level manipulation, employing both in-silico and wetlab experiments. Our team expertise spans computer architecture, programming languages, synthetic biology and biochemistry. 

Our current focus is on using synthetic DNA for data storage, in close collaboration with [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dnastorage/). Using DNA to archive data is an attractive possibility because it is extremely dense, with a raw limit of 1 exabyte per cubic milimeter, and long-lasting, with observed half-life of over 500 years. We are developing a complete system  architecture for DNA-backed archival storage, with support for random access and encoding schemes that offer reliability for density trade-offs.
